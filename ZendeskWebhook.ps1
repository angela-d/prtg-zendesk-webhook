# original script by https://tietze.io/b/2015/09/08/integrating-zendesk-and-prtg/
#
# solves bug: https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/75261-single-quote-in-sensor-message-breaks-notification-script
#
# angela 12/7/18: added:
# - detailed messages & tags that don't break with single quotes
# - local log generator for easy troubleshooting
# - made the script a bit more newb friendly
# - formatting cleanup
#
# This will create a new ticket in PRTG if no open PRTG ticket is found for this device; otherwise it will update the first found open PRTG ticket for this device.

# initialize parameters that will be used later on in the script, more available at: https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/373-what-placeholders-can-i-use-with-prtg
